# Deep Learning Python raster function For ArcGIS

Deep learning model inferencing in ArcGIS is implemented on top of the Python raster function framework. 
This repository serves to provide guidance on deep learning Python raster functions in ArcGIS,
 and to educate users on how to create custom Python raster functions to integrate additional deep learning 
 models with the ArcGIS platform.   

## Prerequisites
1. Deep learning in ArcGIS requires one of the following products:
    - *ArcGIS Pro 2.3 or later*.
    - *ArcGIS Enterprise 10.7 or later*.

2. An ArcGIS Image Analyst license is required to run inferencing tools.

3. CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN

## Getting started
1. Clone raster-deep-learning repository: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Esri/raster-deep-learning.git 
   ```
   
2. [Download sample data, including imagery and trained deep learning models](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MinimalGallery/index.html?appid=99c39f7512d54881bc365583c76c7da6).
   
   - Use the link above to download the sample data and models for four different model frameworks.
3. Set up the Python deep learning environment in ArcGIS. 

   Starting from ArcGIS Pro 2.6 and ArcGIS Enterprise 10.8.1, *[Deep Learning Libraries Installers for ArcGIS](https://github.com/esri/deep-learning-frameworks)* are provided, 
   which include a broad collection of components, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Fast.ai, that are required to run Deep Learning workflows in this repository. 
   Users can download the installers from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/Esri/deep-learning-frameworks.   

   For users on ArcGIS Pro 2.5 and ArcGIS Enterprise 10.8, or older. Please install the required deep learning libraries listed in *[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)* using the following steps:
   
   - Install Python environments in ArcGIS Pro using the *[ArcGIS Pro Python Package Manager](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/get-started/what-is-conda.htm)*.
   
   - Alternatively, ArcGIS Pro users can use this batch file *[env_setup.bat](env_setup.bat)* at the root directory to automatically install 
   all the required deep learning libraries for the sample cases in this repository. 
   NOTE: By default, the batch installation will take up 5 GB of disk space on the C:/ drive (or the disk where ArcGIS Pro is installed). 
   To execute the batch file, right click the batch file and choose to Run as Administrator. This installation takes less than 5 minutes to run on the author's test machine. 
   
   - For ArcGIS Enterprise users, the deep learning libraries need to be installed to the Python environment on each raster analytics server machine: 
   *C:\ArcGIS\Server\framework\runtime\ArcGIS\bin\Python*. 
   The batch file *[env_setup_server_tensorflow.bat](env_setup_server_tensorflow.bat)* at root directory automates the TensorFlow environment setup process for ArcGIS Enterprise 10.7, specifically. 
   It is not recommended to install different deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, etc) into one Enterprise Python environment.   
   NOTE: By default, batch installation will take ~2-3 GB of disk space on the C:/ drive (or the disk where ArcGIS server is installed). To execute the batch file, 
   right click the batch file and choose to Run as Administrator. This installation takes less than 5 minutes to run on the author's test machine.
   Once you finish setting up the Python environment, you will need to restart the ArcGIS server. 
   For more details on setting up the Enterprise environment, see [Configure ArcGIS Image Server for deep learning raster analytics](https://enterprisedev.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/configure-and-deploy-arcgis-enterprise-for-deep-learning-raster-analytics.htm).
    
   - If you prefer to manually setup the deep learning Python environment using command lines, see the example below which 
    installs TensorFlow on the ArcGIS raster analytics server:
       ```
       Step1: Change Directory to ArcGIS python scripts directory.
       cd C:\ArcGIS\Server\framework\runtime\ArcGIS\bin\Python\Scripts
       
       Step2: Clone a new ArcGIS python environment for deep learning.
       conda create --name deeplearning_env_name --clone arcgispro-py3
       
       Step3: Activate the new python environment.
       activate deeplearning_env_name
       
       Step4: Install tensorflow or tensorflow-gpu in the new python environment. 
       conda install tensorflow
       
       Step5: Swap it to the activate python environment of the ArcGIS servers. 
       proswap deeplearning_env_name
       ```
       
4. Get familiar with the format and requirements of the *[Esri model definition file (emd)](docs/writing_model_definition.md)*.

5. (Optional) Get familiar with *Python raster function*.
*[Anatomy of a Python Raster Function](https://github.com/Esri/raster-functions/wiki/PythonRasterFunction#anatomy-of-a-python-raster-function)*.  
 
6. (Optional) If you are interested in writing custom deep learning Python raster functions to integrate additional deep learning
models into ArcGIS, the
*[Custom Python raster function guide](docs/writing_deep_learning_python_raster_functions.md)* provides details 
on the necessary functions and how to implement model inference calls using Python raster function.
